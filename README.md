# mediation_analysis

**What is already known?**
• Peripubertal exposure to TCDD is associated with poorer semen quality (RCS, Minguez-Alarcon et al., 2017)
• 52 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified that distinguished lowest and highest peripubertal serum TCDD concentrations (RCS, Pilsner et al., 2018)
**What is needed to be known**
• How do other factors influence the methylation level of the human sperm? • Which factors can mediate the effect of the peripubertal exposure to TCDD?
 
**Aim of the project:**
Mediation analysis using regression models and longitudinal design
Predictor: peripubertal TCDD concentration
Mediators: smoking and tempo of puberty
Outcomes: sperm methylation profiles (all CpGs with coverage >=10 using RRBS

**What are the data to analyse:**
• 34 samples with different concentration of TCDD in the boy’s serum at enrollment in the study (8-9 years old) 
• Methylation level of 2 611 773 CpGs with coverage >=10 presented in at least one of 34 samples
• Data of lifestyle and pubertal tempo of each of 34 selected participants

**Samples selection:**
