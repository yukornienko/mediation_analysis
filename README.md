# mediation_analysis

**What is already known?**
• Peripubertal exposure to TCDD is associated with poorer semen quality (RCS, Minguez-Alarcon et al., 2017)
• 52 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified that distinguished lowest and highest peripubertal serum TCDD concentrations (RCS, Pilsner et al., 2018)

**What is needed to be known?**
• How do other factors influence the methylation level of the human sperm? • Which factors can mediate the effect of the peripubertal exposure to TCDD?
 
**Aim of the project:**
Mediation analysis using regression models and longitudinal design
Predictor: peripubertal TCDD concentration
Mediators: smoking and tempo of puberty
Outcomes: sperm methylation profiles (all CpGs with coverage >=10 using RRBS

**What are the data to analyse:**
• 34 samples with different concentration of TCDD in the boy’s serum at enrollment in the study (8-9 years old) 
• Methylation level of 2 611 773 CpGs with coverage >=10 presented in at least one of 34 samples
• Data of lifestyle and pubertal tempo of each of 34 selected participants

**What is going to be done with these data:**
1. Building the linear regression model of TCDD concentration and methylation level
2. Selection only those CpGs, which methylation level is significantly dependent on the TCDD concentration.
3. Regress the smoking and pubertal tempo (mediators) on the TCDD (predictor) to confirm that the TCDD is a significant predictor of the mediator. If the mediator is not associated with the TCDD level, then it couldn’t possibly mediate anything
4. Regress the CpGs methylation on both the mediators (smoking and pubertal tempo) and TCDD level to confirm that the mediators are significant predictor of the CpG methylation, and the previously significant predictor in Step #1 is now greatly reduced, if not - nonsignificant
5. To collect a) CpGs with significant mediation by pubertal tempo and/or smoking and b) non-mediated CpGs
6. Biological sense analysis (functional enrichment analyses)
